Playwright, create test scripts, and automate user interactions in a browser.

What this project includes:
- Test setup for Playwright
- Automated creation of To-Do items
- Marking items as completed
- Deleting items from the list
- Verifying expected behavior of the application

Main purpose:
To provide a simple and clear example of UI automation. 
This project can be used as a starting point for building more advanced automation 
frameworks, learning test design, or practicing Playwright.

Requirements:
- Node.js
- Playwright

How to run:
1. Install dependencies with:  npm install
2. Run tests with: npx playwright test
